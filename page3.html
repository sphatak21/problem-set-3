  <h1>Draft Dos and Don’ts</h1>
  <p>Drafting a team is an arduous process for the more competitive player, but the basic rules for drafting apply to all players of this game. Here are some dos and don’ts of the drafting process</p>
  Dos:
  <ul>
    <li>Add players to the queue: Doing this allows for a backup in case your connection to the draft room fails for some reason.</li>
    <li>Create a draft strategy, detailing what players you forecast will be available in what rounds and which of those players you are likely to select</li>
    <li>Coming into the draft with a clear plan will eliminate most of the possibilities of a mistake.</li>
    <li> Make sure your team is balanced. Add players from all different positions to create the best possible team.</li>
  </ul>
